2. `Undergraduate` - Extends `Student` to include the student’s year and eligibility based on student’s year.
3. `Graduate` - Extends `Student` to include the degree sought and eligibility based on degree type.
4. `Project2` - The main class that reads student data from a file, calculates GPA thresholds, and prints eligible students.
5. `students.exe` - the file where the students data exits and it is located in resources folder
